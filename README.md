# minimal-local

My fork of the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) blog theme
[Minimal](https://themes.gohugo.io/minimal/) that uses local files rather than
calling all over the web as well as drops almost all Javascript.

## Changes

* New homepage with list of posts
* Added about type
* Removed Cloudflare and Google dependencies
* Added Goatcounter for analytics
* Customized table format
* Added Code font type
* highlight.js support with most common items
